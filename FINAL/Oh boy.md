<h1> FINAL </h1>


<p> While I have learned an immense amount of things about AR & VR. Also learning about working with 3D software.<br>
Learning both a 3D software and a gaming software works hand in hand if you're looking to create your own game, with your own assets.<br>
Unfortunately, because of how fast the weeks are narrowing down, even faster after I've been sick with Covid-19 and demanding job, I haven't been able to push a FINAL product yet. The prototype I have is the only working version I have, here's the repos.<br> <br>

Even though I haven't been successful in pushing the final version of what I wanted to create as my final project, I have created bits and pieces and learned along the way to create something that might be more complete in the future, now that I've learned the fundamentals to do it. The greatest challenge I had was with time.

<h1> Alright</h1>
<br>
<p> For my project, I was originally planning to create a tomogatchi-inspired AR application based around this lizard.<br>

 I am still able to place and disorient my 3D model, but there is no animation or anything interesting since last time I've shown my prototype. Still even pulling the application on my phone I am still happy that I got it to work. What I've also tried to work on before I got sick was successfully rig my Lizard Model. IT WORKED OUT! I've misplaced or I probably didn't save what I had, but I've recreated what I have done, albeit, a bit janky. <br></p>

Dispite all of the inconveiences that's been thrown my way, I have enjoyed being a part of this class. Hopefully 2021 gets better.
