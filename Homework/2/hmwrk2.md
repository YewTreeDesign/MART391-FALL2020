<h2> Okay, so I have tested out some AR Experiences with Unity by following some instructions provided when using the AR Foundation plug-in for the latest versions of unity. I've figured out how to place images and models in AR by using either Android (my Nokia) and using IOS Devices (my iPad). I've found using either the 2018 or 2019 versions of unity is more optimal to use your mobile device's camera. I recommend following the tutorial (although outdated) above to get started. I've basically achieved similar results in the demo. There's also a GitHub link to the project file.

The type of markers that I've played around with was the marker less and the frame method to place objects.

I would've recorded but OBS couldn't record my unity window for some reason or couldn't identify it. I also didn't have a ton of time to work on this week's homework because of unexpected life events. I may just come back here to upload the footage when I can.

<h3> Short Paper </h3>
<br>
The type of markers that I think that may be more widely practical is either the framed ones because how easy it is to just scan it with your phone's camera to open up a webpage or app, if this can be more implemented into business cards then it would be easier for the employer to just bring up your webpage and such. Then there's the GPS app that is practical to knowing where you're going, and there is something programmed into google maps to bring up some recommendations for restaurants and places to visit. It kind of makes things a bit interesting if you have more time on your hands, it also answers the "where do you wanna eat" sort of questions. Honestly It's hard to choose one over the other because both could serve similar and different kinds of functions but if you want to find directions to a place you've been wanting to go to, a GPS would be a wise decision. Then again you can just scan a QR code of the advertised venue to instantly put in the directions into your google map without having to dig for the address.
