I have successfully placed my custom 3d object into an AR platform. Though very rough, I could potentially push this further.

Since my cinema 4D license ran dry, I could transfer the model into blender and add bones to it so I could easily animate it. Also to fix the mesh textures on the model...
My inspiration is using the AR/QR cards that Nintendo gave away with a purchase of a 3DS. I use to been addicted to this silly game called <i><a href="https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tbP1TcwNDCvKi7OMmD04ivJz81PSUzOyFTIyUxLBQCD5Al0&q=tomodachi+life&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS887US887&oq=tomodatc&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j46j0l5.3489j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"> Tomodatchi Life</a> </i> and there is some mini games that do
require the use of the cards and you can change their poses how ever and where ever and I thought it was cute.
