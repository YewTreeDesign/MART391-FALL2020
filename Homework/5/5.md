Okay, I may have skipped out on homework 4, there is a reason behind it. I've been spending most of my time trying to get this lizard to work! <br>
Good news, I got him to work. Yeah I know his eyes are freaky, honestly it's not my intentions, any 3D fbx and obj files tend to scramble the materials<br>
I suppose those file formats hate eyes for some reason, I'll figure out a way to fix it. Next I'll include animations or something.
<br>

Oh you can scale him and move him around a select area, he also spins as you do it.

<br>
One more thing, if you notice that there should be a palm tree somewhere...Well, It doesn't want to show up.
