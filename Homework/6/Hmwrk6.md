<h3> Web AR </h3>
<hr>
<p>The purpose of this app is to test to see how I am able to present a 3D object in a AR space. People can muse this primordial feat in AR Technology, the lizard. <br>
You can view this suave boy in your room in real time, and he does seem motionless and pretty blank eh? Well, He can be a reference for how he could fit into your desk space if he ever gets 3D printed.<br>
Wouldn't that be great? Just a thought.
<br>
I may have to fiddle with the 3D model's textures some more to get them to show up in their full brilliance at some point. I have figured out what 3D file format that would be most optimal for AR Viewing that<br>
Facebook neglected to promote; GLTF. I'll fiddle more with that format.

I realized my roommates have S as their last initial.

This is what the model was suppose to look like.
