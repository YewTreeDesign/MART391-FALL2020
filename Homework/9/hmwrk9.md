<h1> Homework 9 </h1> <br>
<h3> Testing out some VR Applications </h3>
<hr>

<p> I've tried out <i>InMind VR 2</i>, <i>VR Thrills</i>, and <i>Zombie Shooter VR</i>.
The games are probably the first I've ever tried with my phone, when it comes to VR gaming.
My last VR experience was playing the <i>Nintendo Switch's Labo shooter</i>. Both experiences were the same to me
in how I feel being immersed into a VR environment. It feels very disorienting at first then after awhile I feel
Like I am in the environment. All the games have been fun to play and after I was finished playing and took off the headset
I felt weirded out because my world isn't made up of polygons and pixels like in VR. I can see people getting sucked into VR.<br>

<br> I can see VR being used in educational environments, and especially when everyone is quarantined. Like in AR, people would get a hands on experience, but more in
depth with the means of being in control with in the simulation becomes more sophisticated. We might get some cybernetic suits in the future. or plans to build a VR controlled environment room, like if the player in the simulation is cold you'll also be a bit chilled as a breeze hits you.

Here's my one gripe. I think people looking in to VR needs to consider some ocular and neurological things that one might face while playing any VR game.
Being exposed to blue light for an amount of time can't be good for the eyes and your head. I think after 15 minutes, I started to get a headache.<br>
I guess this would encourage people to take a break from the game.

Overall I had some fun.
