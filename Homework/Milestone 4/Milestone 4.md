<h1>Milestone 4</h1> <br>
<h3> Where am I at?</h3>
<hr>

<p> Here's some disappointment, I've been trying to stay on course, <b>last two week has been awful.</b> I had an awful infection where I had to take some antibiotic for 5 days. I was bedridden for most of my time.
My car was hit and totaled by a drunk driver and having that on my plate while trying to figure out means to get to work has been living
rent free in my mind. As well talking to my insurance. I also had to spend the weekend worrying as everything was put on hold until this Tuesday. I've barely nudged what I was planning to do, but I think I might actually get into adding bones to my 3D model. I don't think
it should take very long to accomplish.

I just hope I'll push something complete at the deadline.
