<h1> The Practicality of AR </h1>

<p> Where I think AR would be the most useful is probably in more of the educational variety. You could be participating in a hands on AR experience, like performing surgery or flying a plane in a augmented reality simulation with out posing any risk in actually attempting it. Heck it could be even be potentially useful in learning a language that you're trying to go out and learn. Imagine wearing a google glass or some augmented reality equipment where every word and letter you see swaps out to the language you want to learn. A lot of people say the best way to learn a language is if immerse yourself in it, like going to the country.
<br>
Now going to the country you want to learn the language from can be a great experience, but not a lot of people have that privilege or time to simply spend a year in a different country. So AR could be very handy to those who really want to learn a new language or to just learn something in general.
